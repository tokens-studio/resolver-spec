## Full implementation with Style Dictionary

Below we will demo what it would look like to use the resolver spec.
Underneath we will display the resolver and token files in a Monaco editor instance.

We have 3 token sets:

- core
- dark
- light

Below is the output of tokens depending on which modifiers are active.

<br />
<sd-demo>
  <div style="height: 120%" slot="monaco-editor"></div>
</sd-demo>

Depending on the modifier for mode (either dark or light), it will use either core + `'dark.json'` or core + `'light.json'`.
Within modifier values, you can use the filename of a tokens file e.g. `'dark.json'`,
but it's also possible to reference the set name e.g. `'core'`, which means any file within that set will be included.

Referencing by name can be useful if you've got multiple files under your `'core'` sets collection.
